Shaun : Manage Catalog

Context:
i put some codes in your edit book method in head Librarian class, so you can start editing from there

you can gloss through the display methods in each class, 
and the set and get methods in the catalog class to see if there is
anything useful to you

it's also better to write your own methods since it's quicker
don't change anything in the existing methods except

manageCatalog - head Librarian class line 13
editBook - head Librarian class line 43
whatToDoWithBook - head Librarian class line 55
